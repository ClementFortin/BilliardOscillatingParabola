This folder contains the code that allows one to rigorously compute a branch solution. It starts at a given solution and does rigorous pseudo-arclength continuation in the surface's amplitude of oscillation. The scripts included are generalized to any number impacts k except for the function D2F.m which only works for k=2. A generalization of this matrix is required for the script to work for any k. Here is a general overview of the structure of the code.

Pseudo_arclength: This is the main file. The user has to either manually enter a periodic orbit for a given epsilon value or provide a path to a .csv file containing periodic orbits as column vectors (for a given row, the first 8 columns must specify the coordinates of the periodic orbit in the order (t0, x0, v0, w0, t1, x1, v1, w1, ...)). It prompts the user to enter parameter values and starts doing continuation by feeding a step size to the "Continuation.m" function. The latter applies iiteratively the theorems that prove existence of a solution curve, the theorem that proves that this curve is smooth and that it does not undergo any secondary bifurcations. To do this, a new jacobian is constructed using the function "dfdE.m" which gives the column vector of the partials w.r.t. the epsilon parameter. When attempting to prove that there exists a solution curve between two points, it uses the second derivative of the f map, or the jacobian of the jacobian when setting the Z2 bound. Since this matrix is of dimension 81x81 for k=2, it has not been attempted to find a generalized version of this matrix to make the code compatible with any value of k. Thus, anyone is welcome in submitting such a file.
