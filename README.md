# BilliardOscillatingParabola

A particle is bouncing on a vertically vibrating parabolic surface. For a given number of impacts between the particle and the surface, periodic orbits are provided for fixed parameter values. A folder containing the code capable of finding these orbits as well as doing rigorous pseudo-arclength continuation in the surface's amplitude of oscillation is presented.

The Solutions folder contains solutions for specific parameter values i.e. steepness of surface (alpha), coefficient of restitution (e), amplitude of the surface's oscillation (epsilon), the number of impacts in a periodic orbit (k) and the period of a periodic orbit (p).

The find_solutions folder contains the code that allows for rigorous computation of periodic orbits given specific parameter values.

The Continuation folder contains the code that allows for rigorous pseudo-arclength continuation.
