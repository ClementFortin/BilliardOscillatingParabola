This folder contains scripts that allow one to find periodic orbits of the f map. Here is a description of each script.

find_solutions.m: This script is the main file. After running the script, the user is prompted to enter values of alpha, epsilon and e as well as a number of impacts k and a period p. The user is then asked to enter a number of solutions to find for these specific parameter values. The code will run until the number of solutions found matches the latter. When searching for a solution, certain conditions will have to be satisfied. Namely, that the solution is physically possible (time_condition.m) and that the solution has not been found even after normalizing the time values (unique_solution.m & normalized_t0.m). After all of that, the existence interval of the solution is determined (existence_interval.m). Throughout this procedure, the f map and its jacobian are constantly called (zero_finding_problem.m & jacobian.m). Finally, the reset law (R_map.m) and the S map (S_map.m) are called upon by the zero_finding_problem.m script.

Note that some of these script use INTLab and thus can not work without it. Please consider downloading the latest version at http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/intlab/.
